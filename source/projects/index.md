Below are the projects I am currently working on. These include both software projects and books about C/C++ or other software.

## dr4

[Website](https://dr4f.github.io/site/)


`dr4` is a revolutionary data format that allows, quick, scalable, and organized access to object oriented data. It's readily usable for data science, logging, machine learning, web applications, and much more.

However, unlike file and data formats such as JSON or XML, `dr4` is unique in that it's binary. dr4 is also designed to be readable and writable without any parsing or handling overhead. Additionally, it can also be used much like CSV, easily appendable or joinable with other dr4 documents, without the extra hassle.

What makes `dr4` unique is that, unlike other binary data formats, it's not limited by a specific size of bytes for the entire document, and can easily be grown without reading the entire file. With formats such as BSON, the entire file is sized by a signed 32-bit integer at the beginning. With dr4, files and documents are treated as unsized collections of objects and data. A small amount of version and meta data is kept at the start of the file, but beyond that, it's pure data!
